# htmx example

super simple app to demo [htmx](https://htmx.org). Uses node, expressjs, and htmx from a cdn link. Not installing htmx.org from npm because you'd need to bundle it then.

Clicking the button sends a AJAX request back to the server, which returns data to replace the target div element.
